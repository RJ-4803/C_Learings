# C Language Projects

## Description
This repository contains a collection of projects developed using the C programming language. These projects cover basic to intermediate programming concepts and help in understanding problem-solving, algorithm implementation, and working with standard C libraries.

## Features
- Implementation of algorithms and data structures
- Console-based programs for learning C fundamentals
- Examples of file handling, pointers, and memory management
- Projects demonstrating logical and mathematical problem-solving

## Explanation
Each project demonstrates core C programming concepts:

- Use of `printf` and `scanf` for input/output
- Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`) for decision-making
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) for iteration
- Functions for modular programming
- Arrays, strings, and pointers for data storage and manipulation
- Structures for organizing related data
- File handling using `fopen`, `fread`, `fwrite`, and `fclose`
